# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project-2

The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999–2008.

Question that various plots answer are :-

1) Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008. Plot 1 tells about this, Code for which is in "plot1.R". 

2) Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008. Plot 2 tells about this, code for which is in "plot2.R". 

3) Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008?
Plot 3 tells about this, code for which is in "plot3.R". 

4) Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008? Plot 4 tells about this, code for which is in "plot4.R". 

5) How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City? Plot 5 tells about this and code is in corresponding R file. 

6) Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
Plot 6 tells about this and code for this is in corresponding file.
